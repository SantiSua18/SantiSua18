# Hello, I'm Santiago Suarez,

##I want to develop myself in the world of programming and polish my programming skills.


I am a programming student with little knowledge, but with a lot of desire and willingness to learn and grow in this world if I could describe my programming level at this moment I would say I am a novice with some knowledge.
